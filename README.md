# Chuck Norris Joke Generator

## Description

This is a simple web project that generates random Chuck Norris Jokes to the user. These jokes come from apis at [The Internet Chuck Norris Database](http://www.icndb.com/api/). The api also allows the user to replace `Chuck Norris` in the joke with the user's first and last name. 

## Use Cases

1. Passing no values into the form will get you 1 random joke
1. Passing an `amount` with other fields blank will get you `amount` number of jokes
1. Passing only name fields without amount will get you only 1 custom name joke
1. Passing only one name field will get you a customized joke with the first/last name as Chuck/Norris depending on the one you left empty.
